# Neural-style-transfer

PyTorch's implementation of Neural Style Transfer. Learning repository with several experiments and playing around.

## Usage

### Gradio app

Run demo app with: `python app.py`

## Jupyter notebook

Run jupyter lab with: `jupyter lab` and open `neural-style-transfer.ipynb`

Experiments done:

1. Gram matrix values (Normalized vs Not-normalized)
2. Number of iterations (Differences in quality)
3. Impact of style losses in different layers
4. Adam vs LBFG-S optimizer
